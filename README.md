# Rock-Paper-Scissors ðŸŽ®

This is my first time creating a Python project.  
Itâ€™s a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game where you play against the computer.  
Itâ€™s not perfect, but I hope it can be of some use to anyone learning like me.

## How to Run
Make sure Python is installed, then run:
```bash
python "Rock Paper Scissors vs.py"
